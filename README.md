# Airgead-Banking
Banking app that computes compound interest based on user's input values (Initial amount, Monthly deposit, Annual interest, Number of years)

# What went well
  * Handling input data from user, storing it in vectors
  * Handling exceptions by validating input on different levels
  * Considering corner cases to provide user with as much detail is possible on what went wrong
# What could be improved
  * Adding functionality to allow user to only re-enter the invalid data
  * Adding functionality to aloow user to change some data on the fly, after reports are ready
  * Graphical user interface
# Challenges
  * Writing the calculations functions in the most efficient and easy to understand way
  * Using Visual Studio on a remote desktop - slowed down the work and made it difficult to debug, had to look for an alternative for Macbook
# Transferable skills
  * Handling data in an unusual to me way - combining variables into vectors even if they don't seem to belong together at first
  * Improved debugging skills - had logic errors in calculations
# Maintainability of the program
  * I tried to stick with best industry practices. One of them was utilising OOP concepts. Another one - writing comprehensive comments for every line of code that didn't seem straighforward on its own.
